# Data Preprocessing Repository

This repository contains Python code for data preprocessing tasks before implementing machine learning models. Below are the main sections covered in this repository:

## 1. Importing Packages
In this section, we import necessary Python packages and libraries that will be used throughout the data preprocessing process.

## 2. Reading DataSet
Here, we load the dataset (presumably in CSV or other formats) into memory using appropriate functions or libraries (such as Pandas).

## 3. Feature and Label
We identify the features (independent variables) and the label (dependent variable) from the dataset.

## 4. Filling Null Values or Data Cleaning
Data cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies. Describe how you handle null values or perform data imputation.

## 5. One-Hot Encoding
If your dataset contains categorical variables, one-hot encoding is essential. Explain how you convert categorical features into numerical representations.

## 6. Encoding Dependent Label (y)
For supervised learning tasks, encoding the dependent label (target variable) is crucial. Describe any transformations applied to the label.

## 7. Splitting Train and Test Data Sets
Splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets is essential for model evaluation. Explain how you divide the data.

## 8. Feature Scaling
Feature scaling ensures that all features have similar scales. Discuss any normalization or standardization techniques used.
